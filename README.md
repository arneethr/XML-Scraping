# XML Parsing and Text Denoising with Python

This Python script reads an XML file, extracts its content, and processes the text to remove unnecessary elements such as HTML tags and square brackets. It also tokenizes and lemmatizes the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Below are detailed instructions on setting up and using this script.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running this script:

- Python 3.x
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `lxml` (for parsing XML files)
- Basic knowledge of XML and text processing

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk beautifulsoup4 lxml
   ```

3. Download the necessary NLTK data by running the following commands in a Python environment:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

## Usage

1. Modify the script to point to your XML file by updating the file path:
   ```python
   os.chdir(r"your_directory_here")
   ```
2. Load and parse your XML file:
   ```python
   tree = ET.parse('your_file.xml')
   ```

3. The script will extract the XML content and process it using functions designed to:
   - Strip HTML tags
   - Remove square brackets
   - Further clean the text by removing spaces

4. The cleaned and denoised text is printed as part of the processing.

## Script Breakdown

- **XML Parsing:**
  The XML file is parsed using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, and the root element is extracted.

- **Text Denoising Functions:**
  - `strip_html(text)`: Removes HTML tags from the text.
  - `remove_square_brackets(text)`: Removes any text enclosed in square brackets.
  - `denoise_text(text)`: Combines the above functions and performs additional cleaning like removing spaces.

- **Third-party Libraries:**
  - `BeautifulSoup`: Helps parse and extract text from HTML content.
  - `nltk`: Used for further NLP tasks, though the tokenization and lemmatization functionality is not implemented yet.

### Example:

The following code snippet denoises the XML file content:
```python
sample = denoise_text(root)
print(sample)
```
